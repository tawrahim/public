	<p><strong>HERE'S HOW WE DISCLOSE AGGREGATE INFORMATION</strong></p>
	<p class="legal-text">
		We may combine your Personal Information and information about your preferences and activities, with those of all or a particular group of 
		our users to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities for our internal use. 
		For example, we may track the number of our users who  use certain features 
		or compile the total dollar amount of trips conducted through the app in a particular geographic
		 region or track purchasing trends. Such information, and other information we derive from individual users' information, 
		 allows us to continue to grow and provide you with quality information through more accurate marketing and advertising of the 
		 app.
	</p>
	
	<p><strong>HERE'S WHAT WE DO TO KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE: </strong></p>
	<p class="legal-text">
		We take commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, 
		disclosure or destruction of your Personal Information that you share and we collect and store. 
		These security measures include read-only replicas of our databases, high durability storage, full daily backups, 
		secure encryption using Amazon S3 (which is designed for 99.99% availability and 99.999999999% durability), 
		SSL encryption, data storage across multiple facilities that exceed industry standards, internal reviews of our 
		data collection practices and platforms, as well as physical security measures to guard against 
		unauthorized access to systems where we store your information. The technology we have employed to
		 deliver our Services to you protects your information using both server authentication and data encryption, 
		 ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and available only to registered users in your organization.
		 
		 <br/>
		 Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 
		 As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information: (a) there are security and privacy 
		 limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of 
		 any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed 
		 and you transmit such information at your own risk; and (c) any such information and data may be 
		 viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.
	</p>
	
	<p><strong>HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION:</strong></p>
	<p class="legal-text">
		While we are committed to taking all reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information, there are steps you can take as well; such as:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Creating strong passwords and use them wisely (e.g.. dont' use the same password for us that you use for your bank, for example
			</li>
			<li>
				Never respond to unsolicited requests for your social security number or financial information
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not disclose your passwords to the app or your Account Information to any other person

		have provided to us and encourage you to promptly update your Personal information if it changes. 
		You may change any of your Personal Information in your Account on the app at any time. If you are concerned about

		or would like your Account deleted or your Personal Information removed from our records or otherwise 
		deactivated, you may contacting us with your request at: support@thetripbuddyapp.com. 
		We may decline requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize 
		the privacy of others, or are extremely impractical. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your 
		Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
	</p>
	
	<p><strong>HERE'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE CHANGE THIS POLICY:</strong></p>
	<p class="legal-text">
		We may amend this Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Policy 
		in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes that, in our sole discretion, 
		we consider to be material, we will notify you by delivering an announcement via our Service to the 
		email address associated with your account or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change
		 becoming effective. It is your responsibility to maintain a valid e-mail address as a registered user. 
		 If you opt out of communications from us, you may not receive these notifications, however they will 
		 still govern your use of the Service, and you are responsible for checking for any changes. If you continue
		 to use the app or the Service after changes become effective, you agree to abide by and be bound by the modified privacy policy
